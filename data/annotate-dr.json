{"id": 8939, "relationship": "a friend", "quote": " He very quickly started a conversation and I actually found out that he had some similar tastes in show movies game and the lot I actually started to enjoy talking to him after a while he really did seem to have changed He got me into fitness and some weight loss and was actually very supportive about it But that all changed when he just went dark for a year or so and I didnt hear a thing from him for that time That is until recently when he started texting me again Instantly he started talking about his break up with the girl Abby that I had met in passing that time before I tried being a good shoulder to cry on telling him that itll all be fine and that he shouldnt get so down about a high school relationship But things got wierd He started talking about Abby like she had planed this break up from the start saying that she manipulated him and used him like a puppet on a string He said that she had been playing him while sleeping with two other guys behind his back and lied to him telling Shane that her parents knew about their relationship It sounded off to me but then he said that she had called the police on him and she had told him to kill himself Advice he had apparently tried taking I was horrified that these things had apparently happened to him and tried by best to try and be a good friend for him in this troubling time But as the week went on he started getting weirder and weirder about it and started obsessing about Abbys actions He started adding to his story and kept saying that hed die just to be with her again even though she had apparently ruined his life ampx200B So thats when I realized that in my senior year I actually had a class with this girl I was curious about it as the things that Shane had told me had grown more and more outlandish I confronted Abby one afternoon and asked her about her relationship with Shane She was more than happy to tell a story similar to the one Shane had but with the details different She had slept with two other boys but only after Shane had insisted they have an open relationship after he was caught sleeping with another woman She had used him for money but only because he insisted on paying for literally everything regardless of if she wanted to pay for herself or not And she had called the police on him but only after she had broken up with him and he had made threats of breaking into her house and raping her I was disgusted obviously From the very beginning I had thought his story was suspect and after what she told me and showed me there was no denying that Shane was either flatout lying for sympathy or was delusional I texted him one last time saying that I wasnt judging him for his actions but I couldnt speak to him anymore And I deleted his Instagram But he still had my Snapchat Shane began texting me there demanding to know why I would stop talking to him I explained in every way I could that after all the things he had done to me my friends and those two girls over the years I just couldnt anymore We texted back and forth for nearly a half an hour him very fast and angry calling me fake and saying that Abby was slandering him and his good name and caught me in her web That she was manipulating me After dozens of messages I said that I wished him the best of luck on getting the help he needed and said that I believed through the good times we had together that he could become a better person eventually He said he didnt need help that the pills werent working and that the therapists never listened So much for what he told me that day he gave me his info and said that I was making shit up just because he had depression He threatened to take screenshots of our messages and take them to his police officer uncle and have me and the girl Abby arrested for", "annotations": []}
