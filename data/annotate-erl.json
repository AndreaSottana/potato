It was not that the rarity of Christmas parties in the parish made this one a wonder, but that Boldwood should be the giver. The announcement had had an abnormal and incongruous sound, as if one should hear of croquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or that some much-respected judge was going upon the stage. That the party was intended to be a truly jovial one there was no room for doubt. A large bough of mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and suspended in the hall of the bachelor's home. Holly and ivy had followed in armfuls. From six that morning till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared and sparkled at its highest, the kettle, the saucepan, and the threelegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; moreover, roasting and basting operations were continually carried on in front of the genial blaze. As it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into which the staircase descended, and all encumbrances were cleared out for dancing. The log which was to form the back-brand of the evening fire was the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could be neither brought nor rolled to its place; and accord- ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew near. II In spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting In the atmosphere of the house. Such a thing had never been attempted before by its owner, and it was now done as by a wrench. Intended gaieties would insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the organ- ization of the whole effort was carried out coldly, by hirelings, and a shadow seemed to move about the rooms, saying that the proceedings were unnatural to the place and the lone man who lived therein, and hence not good. Bathsheba was at this time in her room, dressing for the event. She had called for candles, and Liddy entered and placed one on each side of her mistress's glass. \"Don't go away, Liddy.\" said Bathsheba, almost timidly.\" I am foolishly agitated-i cannot tell why. I wish I had not been obliged to go to this dance; but there's no escaping now. I have not spoken to Mr. Boldwood since the autumn, when I promised to see him at Christmas on business, but I had no idea there was to be anything of this kind.\" \"But I would go now.\" said Liddy, who was going with her; for Boldwood had been indiscriminate in his invitations. \"Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course.\" said Bathsheba.\" But I am THE CAUSE of the party, and that upsets me! -- Don't tell, Liddy.\" \"O no, ma'am, You the cause of it, ma'am?\" \"Yes. I am the reason of the party-i. If it had not been for me, there would never have been one. I can't explain any more -- there's no more to be explained. I wish I had never seen Weatherbury.\" \"That's wicked of you -- to wish to be worse off than you are.\" \"No, Liddy. I have never been free from trouble since I have lived here, and this party is likely to bring me more. Now, fetch my black silk dress, and see how it sits upon me.\" \"But you will leave off that, surely, ma'am? You have been a widowlady fourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on such a night as this.\" \"Is it necessary? No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear any light dress people would say things about me, and I should seem to he rejoicing when I am solemn all the time. The party doesn't suit me a bit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.\" III Boldwood was dressing also at this hour. A tailor from Casterbridge was with him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat that had just been brought home. Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit, and generally difficult to please. The tailor walked round and round him, tugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar, and for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored- Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such niceties as childish, but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat as to an earthquake in South America. Boldwood at last expressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor passing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for the day. \"Oh, Oak.\" said Boldwood. \"I shall of course see you here to-night. Make yourself merry. I am deter- mined that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared.\" \"I'll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early.\" said Gabriel, quietly. \"I am glad indeed to see such a change in 'ee from what it used to be.\" \"Yes-i must own it-i am bright to-night: cheerful and more than cheerful-so much so that I am almost sad again with the sense that all of it is passing away. And sometimes, when I am excessively hopeful and blithe, a trouble is looming in the distance: so that I often get to look upon gloom in me with content, and to fear a happy mood. Still this may be absurd-i feel that it is absurd. Perhaps my day is dawning at last.\" \"I hope it 'ill be a long and a fair one.\" \"Thank you -- thank you. Yet perhaps my cheerful mess rests on a slender hope. And yet I trust my hope. It is faith, not hope. I think this time I reckon with my host. -- Oak, my hands are a little shaky, or some- thing; I can't tie this neckerchief properly. Perhaps you will tie it for me. The fact is, I have not been well lately, you know.\" \"I am sorry to hear that, sir.\" \"Oh, it's nothing. I want it done as well as you can, please. Is there any late knot in fashion, Oak?\" \"I don't know, sir.\" said Oak. His tone had sunk to sadness. Boldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the farmer went on feverishly -- \"Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?\" \"If it is not inconvenient to her she may.\" \"-- Or rather an implied promise.\" \"I won't answer for her implying.\" said Oak, with faint bitterness. \"That's a word as full o' holes as a sieve with them.\" Oak, don't talk like that. You have got quite cynical lately -- how is it? We seem to have shifted our positions: I have become the young and hopeful man, and you the old and unbelieving one. However, does a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on an engagement to marry at some time? Now you know women better than I -- tell me.\" \"I am afeard you honour my understanding too much. However, she may keep such a promise, if it is made with an honest meaning to repair a wrong.\" \"It has not gone far yet, but I think it will soon -- yes, I know it will.\" he said, in an impulsive whisper. \"I have pressed her upon the subject, and she inclines to be kind to me, and to think of me as a husband at a long future time, and that's enough for me. How can I expect more? She has a notion that a woman should not marry within seven years of her husband's disappearance -- that her own self shouldn't, I mean -- because his body was not found. It may be merely this legal reason which influences her, or it may be a religious one, but she is reluctant to talk on the point- Yet she has promised -- implied -- that she will ratify an engagement to-night.\" \"Seven years.\" murmured Oak. \"No, no -- it's no such thing!\" he said, with im- patience. Five years, nine months, and a few days. Fifteen months nearly have passed since he vanished, and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of little more than five years?\" \"It seems long in a forward view. Don't build too much upon such promises, sir. Remember, you have once be'n deceived. Her meaning may be good; but there -- she's young yet.\" \"Deceived? Never!\" said Boldwood, vehemently. \"She never promised me at that first time, and hence she did not break her promise! If she promises me, she'll marry me, Bathsheba is a woman to her word.\" IV Troy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart tavern at Casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass. A knock was given at the door, and Pennyways entered. \"Well, have you seen him?\" Troy inquired, pointing to a chair. \"Boldwood?\" \"No -- Lawyer Long.\" \"He wadn' at home. I went there first, too.\" \"That's a nuisance.\" \"'Tis rather, I suppose.\" \"Yet I don't see that, because a man appears to be drowned and was not, he should be liable for anything. I shan't ask any lawyer -- not I.\" \"But that's not it, exactly. If a man changes his name and so forth, and takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he's a cheat, and that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless a lammocken vagabond; and that's a punishable situation.\" \"Ha-ha! Well done, Pennyways.\" Troy had laughed, but it was with some anxiety that he said, \"Now, what I want to know is this, do you think there's really anything going on between her and Boldwood? Upon my soul, I should never have believed it! How she. must detest me! Have you found out whether she has encouraged him?\" \"I haen't been able to learn. There's a deal of feeling on his side seemingly, but I don't answer for her. I didn't know a word about any such thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was gwine to the party at his house to-night. This is the first time she has ever gone there, they say. And they say that she've not so much as spoke to him since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk believe o't? How- ever, she's not fond of him -- quite offish and quite care less, I know.\" \"I'm not so sure of that.... She's a handsome woman, Pennyways, is she not? Own that you never saw a finer or more splendid creature in your life. Upon my honour, when I set eyes upon her that day I wondered what I could have been made of to be able to leave her by herself so long. And then I was hampered with that bothering show, which I'm free of at last, thank the stars.\" He smoked on awhile, and then added, \"How did she look when you passed by yesterday?\" \"Oh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well fancy; but she looked well enough, far's I know. Just flashed her haughty eyes upon my poor scram body, and then let them go past me to what was yond, much as if I'd been no more than a leafless tree. She had just got off her mare to look at the last wring-down of cider for the year; she had been riding, and so her colours were up and her breath rather quick, so that her bosom plimmed and feli-plimmed and feli-every time plain to my eye. Ay, and there were the fellers round her wringing down the cheese and bustling about and saying, Ware o' the pommy, ma'am: 'twill spoil yer gown. \"Never mind me,\" says she. Then Gabe brought her some of the new cider, and she must needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not in a nateral way at all. \"Liddy,\" says she, \"bring indoors a few gallons, and I'll make some cider-wine.\" Sergeant, I was no more to her than a morsel of scroffin the fuel house!\" \"I must go and find her out at once -- O yes, I see that-i must go. Oak is head man still, isn't he?\" \"Yes, 'a b'lieve. And at Little Weatherbury Farm too. He manages everything.\" \"Twill puzzle him to manage her, or any other man of his compass!\" \"I don't know about that. She can't do without him, and knowing it well he's pretty independent. And she've a few soft corners to her mind, though I've never been able to get into one, the devil's in't!\" \"Ah baily she's a notch above you, and you must own it: a higher class of animal-a finer tissue. How- ever, stick to me, and neither this haughty goddess, dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine (Juno was a goddess, you know), nor anybody else shall hurt you. But all this wants looking into, I perceive. What with one thing and another, I see that my work is well cut out for me.\" V \"How do I look to-night, Liddy?\" said Bathsheba, giving a final adjustment to her dress before leaving the glass. \"I never saw you look so well before. Yes-i'll tell you when you looked like it -- that night, a year and a half ago, when you came in so wildlike, and scolded us for making remarks about you and Mr. Troy.\" \"Everybody will think that I am setting myself to captivate Mr. Boldwood, I suppose.\" she murmured. \"At least they'll say so. Can't my hair be brushed down a little flatter? I dread going -- yet I dread the risk of wounding him by staying away.\"Anyhow, ma'am, you can't well be dressed plainer than you are, unless you go in sackcloth at once. 'Tis your excitement is what makes you look so noticeable to-night.\" \"I don't know what's the matter, I feel wretched at one time, and buoyant at another. I wish I could have continued quite alone as I have been for the last year or so, with no hopes and no fears, and no pleasure and no grief. \"Now just suppose Mr. Boldwood should ask you -- only just suppose it -- to run away with him, what would you do, ma'am?\" \"Liddy -- none of that.\" said Bathsheba, gravely. \"Mind, I won't hear joking on any such matter. Do you hear?\" \"I beg pardon, ma'am. But knowing what rum things we women be, I just said -- however, I won't speak of it again.\" \"No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, \"twill be for reasons very, very different from those you think, or others will believe! Now get my cloak, for it is time to go.\" VI \"Oak, said Boldwood, \"before you go I want to mention what has been passing in my mind lately -- that little arrangement we made about your share in the farm I mean. That share is small, too small, consider- ing how little I attend to business now, and how much time and thought you give to it. Well, since the world is brightening for me, I want to show my sense of it by increasing your proportion in the partnership. I'll make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck me as likely to be convenient, for I haven't time to talk about it now; and then we'll discuss it at our leisure. My intention is ultimately to retire from the manage- ment altogether, and until you can take all the expendi- ture upon your shoulders, I'll be a sleeping partner in the stock. Then, if I marry her -- and I hope-i feel I shall, why -- -- \" \"Pray don't speak of it, sir.\" said Oak, hastily. \"We don't know what may happen. So many upsets may befall 'ee. There's many a slip, as they say -- and I would advise you-i know you'll pardon me this once -- not to be TOO SURE.\" \"I know, I know. But the feeling I have about in- creasing your share is on account of what I know of you Oak, I have learnt a little about your secret: your interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an em- ployer. But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a sort of successful rival-successful partly through your goodness of heart -- should like definitely to show my sense of your friendship under what must have been a great pain to you.\" \"O that's not necessary, thank 'ee.\" said Oak, hurriedly. \"I must get used to such as that; other men have, and so shall I.\" Oak then left him. He was uneasy on Boldwood's account, for he saw anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man he once had been. As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone -- ready and dressed to receive his company -- the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed to pass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity. He looked out of the window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the sky, and the twilight deepening to darkness. Then he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer therein a small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to put it into his pocket. But he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary glance inside. It contained a woman's finger-ring, set all the way round with small diamonds, and from its appearance had evidently been recently purchased. Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long time, though that its material aspect concerned him little was plain from his manner and mien, which were those of a mind following out the presumed thread of that jewel's future history. The noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible. Boldwood closed the box, stowed it away carefully in his pocket, and went out upon the landing. The old man who was his indoor factotum came at the same moment to the foot of the stairs. \"They be coming, sir -- lots of 'em -- a-foot and a- driving!\" \"I was coming down this moment. Those wheels I heard -- is it Mrs. Troy?\" \"No, sir -- 'tis not she yet.\" A reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood's face again, but it poorly cloaked his feel- ings when he pronounced Bathsheba's name; and his feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh as he went down the stairs. VII \"How does this cover me?\" said Troy to Pennyways, \"Nobody would recognize me now, I'm sure.\" He was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of Noachian cut, with cape and high collar, the latter being erect and rigid, like a girdling wall, and nearly reaching to the verge of travelling cap which was pulled down over his ears. Pennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up and deliberately inspected Troy \"You've made up your mind to go then?\" he said. \"Made up my mind? Yes; of course I have.\" \"Why not write to her? 'Tis a very queer corner that you have got into, sergeant. You see all these things will come to light if you go back, and they won't sound well at all. Faith, if I was you I'd even bide as you be -- a single man of the name of Francis. A good wife is good, but the best wife is not so good as no wife at all. Now that's my outspoke mind, and I've been called a long-headed feller here and there.\" \"All nonsense!\" said Troy, angrily. \"There she is with plenty of money, and a house and farm, and horses, and comfort, and here am I living from hand to mouth -- a needy adventurer. Besides, it is no use talking now; it is too late, and I am glad of it; I've been seen and recognized here this very afternoon. I should have gone back to her the day after the fair, if it hadn't been for you talking about the law, and rubbish about getting a separation; and I don't put it off any longer. What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all, I can't think! Humbugging sentiment -- that's what it was. But what man on earth was to know that his wife would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name!\" \"I should have known it. She's bad enough for anything.\" \"Pennyways, mind who you are talking to.\" \"Well, sergeant, all I say is this, that if I were you I'd go abroad again where I came from -- 'tisn't too late to do it now. I wouldn't stir up the business and get a bad name for the sake of living with her -- for all that about your play-acting is sure to come out, you know, although you think otherwise. My eyes and limbs, there'll be a racket if you go back just now -- in the middle of Bold- wood's Christmasing!\" \"H'm, yes. I expect I shall not be a very welcome guest if he has her there.\" said the sergeant, with a slight laugh. \"A sort of Alonzo the Brave; and when I go in the guests will sit in silence and fear, and all laughter and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the chamber burn blue, and the worms -- Ugh, horrible! -- Ring for some more brandy, Pennyways, I felt an awful shudder just then! Well, what is there besides? A stick-i must have a walking-stick.\" Pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty, for should Bathsheba and Troy become recon- ciled it would be necessary to regain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her husband. I sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman at bottom.\" he said, as a saving sentence. \"But there's no telling to a certainty from a body's outside. Well, you'll do as you like about going, of course, sergeant, and as for me, I'll do as you tell me.\" \"Now, let me see what the time is.\" said Troy, after emptying his glass in one draught as he stood. 'Half- past six o'clock. I shall not hurry along the road, and shall be there then before nine.\" ","paragraph0_beginOffset":678047,"paragraph0_qc_offsets":"680170-680179,680650-680659,685927-685936,689856-689865,690930-690939,694574-694583","paragraph0_cc_offsets":"678086-678094,678263-678271,680342-680345,680346-680354,680396-680399,680546-680554,680582-680585,681817-681825,682053-682061,682329-682337,682504-682512,683821-683829,685784-685792,686208-686216,686927-686935,687055-687058,687120-687123,687286-687289,687413-687416,687512-687515,690199-690202,690203-690211,690363-690366,690796-690799,690800-690808,690868-690871,691320-691328,692982-692990,693006-693008,693064-693067,693080-693082,693101-693109,693130-693133,693177-693180,693218-693221,693295-693297,693425-693427,693565-693568,693581-693583,693789-693797,693889-693892,693915-693918,694091-694099,694144-694147,694495-694503,694540-694543,694560-694562,694596-694599,694674-694677,694703-694706,694716-694718,694838-694840,695058-695061","paragraph1":"CHAPTER LIII ","paragraph1_beginOffset":698025,"paragraph1_qc_offsets":null,"paragraph1_cc_offsets":null,"paragraph2":"CONCURRITUR -- HORAE MOMENTO ","paragraph2_beginOffset":698041,"paragraph2_qc_offsets":null,"paragraph2_cc_offsets":null, "annotations": []}

He exhibited the un- pleasant combination of a restless condition with a silent tongue. The next day, which was Sunday, passed nearly in the same manner as regarded their taciturnity, Bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon. This was the day before the Budmouth races. In the evening Troy said, suddenly -- \"Bathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?\" Her countenance instantly sank.\" Twenty pounds? she said. \"The fact is, I want it badly.\" The anxiety upon Troy's face was unusual and very marked. lt was a culmination of the mood he had been in all the day. \"Ah! for those races to-morrow.\" Troy for the moment made no reply. Her mistake had its advantages to a man who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now. \"Well, suppose I do want it for races?\" he said, at last. \"O, Frank!\" Bathsheba replied, and there was such a volume of entreaty in the words. \"Only such a few weeks ago you said that I was far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that you would give them all up for me; and now, won't you give up this one, which is more a worry than a pleasure? Do, Frank. Come, let me fascinate you by all I can do -- by pretty words and pretty looks, and everything I can think of -- to stay at home. Say yes to your wife -- say yes!\" The tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba's nature were prominent now -- advanced impulsively for his acceptance, without any of the disguises and defences which the wariness of her character when she was cool too frequently threw over them. Few men could have resisted the arch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful face, thrown a little back and sideways in the well known attitude that expresses more than the words it accompanies, and which seems to have been designed for these special occasions. Had the woman not been his wife, Troy would have succumbed instantly; as it was, he thought he would not deceive her longer. \"The money is not wanted for racing debts at all,\" he said. \"What is it for?\" she asked. \"You worry me a great deal by these mysterious responsibilities, Frank.\" Troy hesitated. He did not now love her enough to allow himself to be carried too far by her ways. Yet it was necessary to be civil. \"You wrong me by such a suspicious manner, he said. \"Such strait-waistcoating as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a date.\" \"I think that I have a right to grumble a little if I pay.\" she said, with features between a smile and a pout. Exactly; and, the former being done, suppose we proceed to the latter. Bathsheba, fun is all very well, but don't go too far, or you may have cause to regret something.\" She reddened. \"I do that already.\" she said, quickly \"What do you regret?\" SUSPICION \"That my romance has come to an end.\" \"All romances end at marriage.\" \"I wish you wouldn't talk like that. You grieve me to my soul by being smart at my expense.\" \"You are dull enough at mine. I believe you hate me.\" \"Not you -- only your faults. I do hate them.\" \"'Twould be much more becoming if you set your- self to cure them. Come, let's strike a balance with the twenty pounds, and be friends.\" She gave a sigh of resignation. \"I have about that sum here for household expenses. If you must have it, take it.\" \"Very good. Thank you. I expect I shall have gone away before you are in to breakfast to-morrow.\" \"And must you go? Ah! there was a time, Frank, when it would have taken a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me. You used to call me darling, then. But it doesn't matter to you how my days are passed now.\" \"I must go, in spite of sentiment.\" Troy, as he spoke, looked at his watch, and, apparently actuated by NON LUCENDO principles, opened the case at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small coil of hair. Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she saw the action and saw the hair. She flushed in pain and surprise, and some words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it was wise to utter them. \"A woman's curl of hair!\" she said. \"O, Frank, whose is that?\" Troy had instantly closed his watch. He carelessly replied, as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred.\" Why, yours, of course. Whose should it be? I had quite forgotten that I had it.\" \"What a dreadful fib, Frank!\" \"I tell you I had forgotten it!\" he said, loudly. \"I don't mean that -- it was yellow hair.\" \"Nonsense.\" \"That's insulting me. I know it was yellow. Now whose was it? I want to know.\" \"Very well I'll tell you, so make no more ado. It is the hair of a young woman I was going to marry before I knew you.\" \"You ought to tell me her name, then.\" \"I cannot do that.\" \"Is she married yet?\" \"No.\" \"Is she alive?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is she pretty?\" \"Yes.\" \"It is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful affliction!\" \"Affliction -- what affliction?\" he inquired, quickly. \"Having hair of that dreadful colour.\" \"Oh -- ho-i like that!\" said Troy, recovering him- self. \"Why, her hair has been admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it loose, which has not been long. It is beautiful hair. People used to turn their heads to look at it, poor girl!\" \"Pooh! that's nothing -- that's nothing!\" she ex- claimed, in incipient accents of pique. \"If I cared for your love as much as I used to I could say people had turned to look at mine.\" \"Bathsheba, don't be so fitful and jealous. You knew what married life would be like, and shouldn't have entered it if you feared these contingencies.\" Troy had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in her throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full. Ashamed as she was to show emotion, at last she burst out: -- \"This is all I get for loving you so well! Ah! when I married you your life was dearer to me than my own. I would have died for you -- how truly I can say that I would have died for you! And now you sneer at my foolishness in marrying you. O! is it kind to me to throw my mistake in my face? Whatever opinion you may have of my wisdom, you should not tell me of it so mercilessly, now that I am in your power.\" \"I can't help how things fall out.\" said Troy; \"upon my heart, women will be the death of me!\" \"Well you shouldn't keep people's hair. You'll burn it, won't you, Frank?\" Frank went on as if he had not heard her. \"There are considerations even before my consideration for you; reparations to be made -- ties you know nothing of If you repent of marrying, so do I.\" Trembling now, she put her hand upon his arm, saying, in mingled tones of wretchedness and coaxing, \"I only repent it if you don't love me better than any woman in the world! I don't otherwise, Frank. You don't repent because you already love somebody better than you love me, do you?\" \"I don't know. Why do you say that?\" \"You won't burn that curl. You like the woman who owns that pretty hair -- yes; it is pretty -- more beautiful than my miserable black mane! Well, it is no use; I can't help being ugly. You must like her best, if you will!\" \"Until to-day, when I took it from a drawer, I have never looked upon that bit of hair for several months -- that I am ready to swear.\" \"But just now you said \"ties;\" and then -- that woman we met?\" \"'Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair.\" \"Is it hers, then?\" \"Yes. There, now that you have wormed it out of me, I hope you are content.\" \"And what are the ties?\" \"Oh! that meant nothing -- a mere jest.\" \"A mere jest!\" she said, in mournful astonishment. \"Can you jest when I am so wretchedly in earnest? Tell me the truth, Frank. I am not a fool, you know, although I am a woman, and have my woman's moments. Come! treat me fairly.\" she said, looking honestly and fearlessly into his face. \"I don't want much; bare justice -- that's all! Ah! once I felt I could be content with nothing less than the highest homage from the husband I should choose. Now, anything short of cruelty will content me. Yes! the independent and spirited Bathsheba is come to this!\" \"For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!\"Troy said, snappishly, rising as he did so, and leaving the room. Directly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs -- dry-eyed sobs, which cut as they came, without any softening by tears. But she determined to repress all evidences of feeling. She was conquered; but she would never own it as long as she lived. Her pride was indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her own. She chafed to and fro in rebelliousness, like a caged leopard; her whole soul was in arms, and the blood fired her face. Until she had met Troy, Bath- sheba had been proud of her position as a woman; it had been a glory to her to know that her lips had been touched by no man's on earth -- that her waist had never been encircled by a lover's arm. She hated herself now. In those earlier days she had always nourished a secret contempt for girls who were the slaves of the first goodlooking young fellow who should choose to salute them. She had never taken kindly to the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about her. In the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to marry him; but the perception that had accompanied her happiest hours on this account was rather that of self-sacrifice than of promotion and honour. Although she scarcely knew the divinity's name, Diana was the goddess whom Bathsheba instinctively adored. That she had never, by look, word, or sign, encouraged a man to approach her -- that she had felt herself sufficient to herself, and had in the independence of her girlish heart fancied there was a certain degradation in renouncing the simplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler half of an indifferent matrimonial whole -- were facts now bitterly remembered. O, if she had never stooped to folly of this kind, respectable as it was, and could only stand again, as she had stood on the hill at Norcombe, and dare Troy or any other man to pollute a hair of her head by his interference! The next morning she rose earlier than usual, and had the horse saddled for her ride round the farm in the customary way. When she came in at half-past eight -- their usual hour for breakfasting -- she was in- formed that her husband had risen, taken his breakfast, and driven off to Casterbridge with the gig and Poppet. After breakfast she was cool and collected -- quite herself in fact -- and she rambled to the gate, intending to walk to another quarter of the farm, which she still personally superintended as well as her duties in the house would permit, continually, however, finding her- self preceded in forethought by Gabriel Oak, for whom she began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister. Of course, she sometimes thought of him in the light of an old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what life with him as a husband would have been like; also of life with Boldwood under the same conditions. But Bathsheba, though she could feel, was not much given to futile dreaming, and her musings under this head were short and entirely confined to the times when Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident. She saw coming up the road a man like Mr. Boldwood. It was Mr. Boldwood. Bathsheba blushed painfully, and watched. The farmer stopped when still a long way off, and held up his hand to Gabriel Oak, who was in a footpath across the field. The two men then approached each other and seemed to engage in earnest conversation. Thus they continued for a long time. Joseph Poor- grass now passed near them, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba's residence. Boldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a few minutes, and then all three parted, Joseph immediately coming up the hill with his barrow. Bathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some surprise, experienced great relief when Boldwood turned back again. \"Well, what's the message, Joseph?\" she said. He set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself the refined aspect that a conversation with a lady re- quired, spoke to Bathsheba over the gate. \"You'll never see Fanny Robin no more -- use nor principal -- ma'am.\" \"Why?\" \"Because she's dead in the Union.\" \"Fanny dead -- never!\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"What did she die from?\" \"I don't know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was from general weakness of constitution. She was such a limber maid that 'a could stand no hardship, even when I knowed her, and 'a went like a candle-snoff, so 'tis said. She was took bad in the morning, and, being quite feeble and worn out, she died in the evening. She belongs by law to our parish; and Mr. Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three this afternoon to fetch her home here and bury her.\" \"Indeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such thing-i shall do it! Fanny was my uncle's servant, and, although I only knew her for a couple of days, FANNY IS SENT FOR she belongs to me. How very, very sad this is! -- the idea of Fanny being in a workhouse.\" Bathsheba had begun to know what suffering was, and she spoke with real feeling.... \"Send across to Mr. Boldwood's, and say that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty of fetching an old servant of the family.... We ought not to put her in a waggon; we'll get a hearse.\" \"There will hardly be time, ma'am, will there?\" \"Perhaps not.\" she said, musingly. \"When did you say we must be at the door -- three o'clock?\" \"Three o'clock this afternoon, ma'am, so to speak it.\" \"Very well-you go with it. A pretty waggon is better than an ugly hearse, after all. Joseph, have the new spring waggon with the blue body and red wheels, and wash it very clean. And, Joseph -- -- \" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her coffin -- indeed, gather a great many, and completely bury her in them. Get some boughs of laurustinus, and variegated box, and yew, and boy'siove; ay, and some hunches of chrysanthemum. And let old Pleasant draw her, because she knew him so well.\"I will, ma'am. I ought to have said that the Union, in the form of four labouring men, will meet me when I gets to our churchyard gate, and take her and bury her according to the rites of the Board of Guardians, as by law ordained.\" \"Dear me -- Casterbridge Union -- and is Fanny come to this?\" said Bathsheba, musing. \"I wish I had known of it sooner. I thought she was far away. How long has she lived there?\" \"On'y been there a day or two.\" \"Oh! -- then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate?\" \"No. She first went to live in a garrison-town t'other side o' Wessex, and since then she's been picking up a living at seampstering in Melchester for several months, at the house of a very respectable widow-woman who takes in work of that sort. She only got handy the Union-house on Sunday morning 'a b'lieve, and 'tis sup- posed here and there that she had traipsed every step of the way from Melchester. Why she left her place, I can't say, for I don't know; and as to a lie, why, I wouldn't tell it. That's the short of the story, ma'am.\" \"Ah-h!\" No gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one more rapidly than changed the young wife's counten- ance whilst this word came from her in a long-drawn breath. \"Did she walk along our turnpike-road?\" she said, in a suddenly restless and eager voice. \"I believe she did.... Ma'am, shall I call Liddy? You bain't well, ma'am, surely? You look like a lily -- so pale and fainty!\" \"No; don't call her; it is nothing. When did she pass Weatherbury?\" \"Last Saturday night.\" \"That will do, Joseph; now you may go.\" Certainly, ma'am.\" \"Joseph, come hither a moment. What was the colour of Fanny Robin's hair?\" \"Really, mistress, now that 'tis put to me so judge- and-jury like, I can't call to mind, if ye'll believe me!\" \"Never mind; go on and do what I told you. Stop -- well no, go on.\" She turned herself away from him, that he might no longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly upon her, and went indoors with a distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow. About an hour after, she heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still with a painful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled look. Joseph, dressed in his best suit of clothes, was putting in the horse to start. The shrubs and flowers were all piled in the waggon, as she had directed Bathsheba hardly saw them now. \"Whose sweetheart did you say, Joseph?\" \"I don't know, ma'am.\" \"Are you quite sure?\" \"Yes, ma'am, quite sure.\"Sure of what?\" \"I'm sure that all I know is that she arrived in the morning and died in the evening without further parley. What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told me was only these few words. `Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,' Gabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way. I was very sorry, and I said, `Ah! -- and how did she come to die?' `Well, she's dead in Casterhridge Union,' he said, `and perhaps 'tisn't much matter about how she came to die. She reached the Union early Sunday morning, and died in the afternoon -- that's clear enough.' Then I asked what she'd been doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and left off spitting a thistle with the end of his stick. He told me about her having lived by seampstering in Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and that she walked therefrom at the end of last week, passing near here Saturday night in the dusk. They then said I had better just name a hint of her death to you, and away they went. Her death might have been brought on by biding in the night wind, you know, ma'am; for people used to say she'd go off in a decline: she used to cough a good deal in winter time. However, 'tisn't much odds to us about that now, for 'tis all over.\" \"Have you heard a different story at all?' She looked at him so intently that Joseph's eyes quailed. \"Not a word, mistress, I assure 'ee!\" he said. \"Hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet.\" \"I wonder why Gabriel didn't bring the message to me himself. He mostly makes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand.\" These words were merely murmured, and she was looking upon the ground. \"Perhaps he was busy, ma'am.\" Joseph suggested. \"And sometimes he seems to suffer from things upon his mind, connected with the time when he was better off than 'a is now. 'A's rather a curious item, but a very understanding shepherd, and learned in books.\" \"Did anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about this?\" \"I cannot but say that there did, ma'am. He was terrible down, and so was Farmer Boldwood.\" \"Thank you, Joseph. That will do. Go on now, or you'll be late.\" Bathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again. In the course of the afternoon she said to Liddy, Who had been informed of the occurrence, \" What was the colour of poor Fanny Robin's hair? Do you know? I cannot recollect-i only saw her for a day or two.\" \"It was light, ma'am; but she wore it rather short, and packed away under her cap, so that you would hardly notice it. But I have seen her let it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful then. Real golden hair.\" \"Her young man was a soldier, was he not?\" \"Yes. In the same regiment as Mr. Troy. He says he knew him very well.\"What, Mr. Troy says so? How came he to say that?\" \"One day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny's young man. He said, \"O yes, he knew the young man as well as he knew himself, and that there wasn't a man in the regiment he liked better.\" \"Ah! Said that, did he?\" \"Yes; and he said there was a strong likeness be- tween himself and the other young man, so that some- times people mistook them -- -- \" \"Liddy, for Heaven's sake stop your talking!\" said Bathsheba, with the nervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions.

He subscribed, therefore, a warrant of attorney, such as the curate's skill enabled him to draw up; for in those simple days the clergy were often the advisers of their flock in law as well as in gospel.

To prosecute a suit at court, ready money was as indispensable even in the golden days of Elizabeth as at any succeeding period; and it was a commodity little at the command of the inhabitants of Lidcote Hall. Tressilian was himself poor; the revenues of good Sir Hugh Robsart were consumed, and even anticipated, in his hospitable mode of living; and it was finally necessary that the herald who started the doubt should himself solve it. Master Michael Mumblazen did so by producing a bag of money, containing nearly three hundred pounds in gold and silver of various coinage, the savings of twenty years, which he now, without speaking a syllable upon the subject, dedicated to the service of the patron whose shelter and protection had given him the means of making this little hoard. Tressilian accepted it without affecting a moment's hesitation, and a mutual grasp of the hand was all that passed betwixt them, to express the pleasure which the one felt in dedicating his all to such a purpose, and that which the other received from finding so material an obstacle to the success of his journey so suddenly removed, and in a manner so unexpected.

But then Wayland was in danger from the grasp of law; and of this Tressilian reminded him, mentioning something, at the same time, of the pincers of Pinniewinks and the warrant of Master Justice Blindas.

This well-favoured and comely girl soon made appre- ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young Farmer Oak. Love, being an extremely exacting usurer (a sense of exorbitant profit, spiritually, by an exchange of hearts, being at the bottom of pure passions, as that of exorbi- tant profit, bodily or materially, is at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere), every morning Oak's feelings were as sensitive as the money-market in calculations upon his chances. His dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which Oak waited for the girl's presence, that the farmer was quite struck with the resemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at the dog. However, he continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming, and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself. Oak had nothing finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able to frame love phrases which end where they begin; passionate tales -- -- Full of sound and fury -- signifying nothing -- he said no word at all. By making inquiries he found that the girl's name was Bathsheba Everdene, and that the cow would go dry in about seven days. He dreaded the eight day. At last the eighth day came. The cow had ceased to give milk for that year, and Bathsheba Everdene came up the hill no more. Gabriel had reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short time before. He liked saying `Bathsheba' as a private enjoyment instead of whistling; turned over his taste to black hair, though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy, isolated himself till the space he filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness. Marriage transforms a distraction into a support, the power of which should be, and happily often is, in direct pro- portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants. Oak began now to see light in this direction, and said to himself, \"I'll make her my wife, or upon my soul I shall be good for nothing!\" All this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba's aunt. He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe, mother of a living lamb. On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution-a fine January morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible to make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an occasional gleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday basket, and stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the aunt -- George, the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking. Gabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with strange meditation. At evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin -- seen the hearth and Bathsheba beside it -- beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath- sheba Everdene. He had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind -- of a nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly ornate -- of a degree between fine-market-day and wet- Sunday selection. He thoroughly cleaned his silver watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his boots, looked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vigorously on his way back; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box, put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either, and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry, sandy, and inextricably curly hair, till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour, between that of guano and Roman cement, making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg, or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb. Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves; one might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of those under them. It seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one, for, as the rather untoward commence- ment of Oak's overtures, just as he arrived by the garden gate, he saw a cat inside, going into various arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George. The dog took no notice , for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath -- in fact he never barked even at the sheep except to order, when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Com- mination-service, which, though offensive, had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good. A voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into which the cat had run: \"Poor dear! Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it; -- did he poor dear!\" \"I beg your pardon.\" said Oak to the voice, \"but George was walking on behind me with a temper as mild as milk.\" Almost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer. Nobody appeared, and he heard the person retreat among the bushes. Gabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of reverie. Where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better, any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure. Oak went up to the door a little abashed: his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening. Bathsheba's aunt was indoors. \"Will you tell Miss Everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to her?\" said Mr. Oak. (Calling one's self merely Some- body, without giving a name, is not to be taken as an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it springs from a refined modesty, of which townspeople, with their cards and announcements, have no notion whatever.) Bathsheba was out. The voice had evidently been hers. \"Will you come in, Mr. Oak?\" \"Oh, thank 'ee, said Gabriel, following her to the fireplace. \"I've brought a lamb for Miss Everdene. I thought she might like one to rear; girls do.\" \"She might.\" said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; \" though she's only a visitor here. If you will wait a minute, Bathsheba will be in.\" \"Yes, I will wait.\" said Gabriel, sitting down. \"The lamb isn't really the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst. In short, I was going to ask her if she'd like to be married.\" \"And were you indeed?\" \"Yes. Because if she would, I should be very glad to marry her. D'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all?\" \"Let me think,\" said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire superfluously.... \"Yes -- bless you, ever so many young men. You see, Farmer Oak, she's so good-looking, and an excellent scholar besides -- she was going to be a governess once, you know, only she was too wild. Not that her young men ever come here -- but, Lord, in the nature of women, she must have a dozen!\" \"That's unfortunate.\" said Farmer Oak, contemplating a crack in the stone floor with sorrow. \"I'm only an every-day sort of man, and my only chance was in being the first comer... , Well, there's no use in my waiting, for that was all I came about: so I'll take myself off home-along, Mrs. Hurst.\" When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down, he heard a \"hoi-hoi!\" uttered behind him, in a piping note of more treble quality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when shouted across a field. He looked round, and saw a girl racing after him, waving a white handkerchief. Oak stood still -- and the runner drew nearer. It was Bathsheba Everdene. Gabriel's colour deepened: hers was already deep, not, as it appeared, from emotion, but from running. \"Farmer Oak -- I -- \" she said, pausing for want of breath pulling up in front of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side. \"I have just called to see you,\" said Gabriel, pending her further speech. \"Yes-I know that!\" she said panting like a robin, her face red and moist from her exertions, like a peony petal before the sun dries off the dew. \"I didn't know you had come to ask to have me, or I should have come in from the garden instantly. I ran after you to say -- that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me -- -- -- \" Gabriel expanded.\"I'm sorry to have made you run so fast, my dear.\" he said, with a grateful sense of favours to come. \"Wait a bit till you've found your breath.\" \"-- It was quite a mistake-aunt's telling you I had a young man \"already.\"- Bathsheba went on. \"I haven't a sweetheart at all -- and I never had one, and I thought that, as times go with women, it was such a pity to send you away thinking that I had several.\" \"Really and truly I am glad to hear that!\" said Farmer Oak, smiling one of his long special smiles, and blushing with gladness. He held out his hand to take hers, which, when she had eased her side by pressing it there, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud-beating heart. Directly he seized it she put it behind her, so that it slipped through his fingers like an eel. \" \"I have a nice snug little farm.\" said Gabriel, with half a degree less assurance than when he had seized her hand. \"Yes; you have.\" \"A man has advanced me money to begin with, but still, it will soon be paid off and though I am only an every-day sort of man, I have got on a little since I was a boy.\" Gabriel uttered \"a little\" in a tone to-show her that it was the complacent form of \"a great deal.\" e continued: \" When we be married, I am quite sure I can work twice as hard as I do now.\" He went forward and stretched out his arm again. Bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush, now laden with red berries. Seeing his advance take the form of an attitude threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of her person, she edged off round the bush. \"Why, Farmer Oak.\" she said, over the top, looking at him with rounded eyes, \"I never said I was going to marry you.\" \"Well -- that is a tale!\" said Oak, with dismay.\" To run after anybody like this, and then say you don't want him!\" \"What I meant to tell you was only this.\" she said eagerly, and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for herself -- \"that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my having a dozen, as my aunt said; I hate to be thought men's property in that way, though possibly I shall be had some day. Why, if I'd wanted you I shouldn't have run after you like this; 'twould have been the forwardest thing! But there was no harm in 'hurrying to correct a piece of false news that had been told you.\" \"Oh, no -- no harm at all.\" But there is such a thing as being too generous in expressing a judgment impuls- ively, and Oak added with a more appreciative sense of all the circumstances -- \"Well, I am not quite certain it was no harm.\" \"Indeed, I hadn't time to think before starting whether I wanted to marry or not, for you'd have been gone over the hill.\" \"Come.\" said Gabriel, freshening again; \"think a minute or two. I'll wait a while, Miss Everdene. Will you marry me? Do, Bathsheba. I love you far more than common!\" \"I'll try to think.\" she observed, rather more timor- ously; \"if I can think out of doors; my mind spreads away so.\" \"But you can give a guess.\" \"Then give me time.\" Bathsheba looked thought- fully into the distance, away from the direction in which Gabriel stood. \"I can make you happy,\" said he to the back of her head, across the bush. \"You shall have as piano in a year or two -- farmers' wives are getting to have pianos now -- and I'll practise up the flute right well to play with you in the evenings.\" \"Yes; I should like that.\" \"And have one of those little ten-pound\" gigs for market -- and nice flowers, and birds -- cocks and hens I mean, because they be useful.\" continued Gabriel, feeling balanced between poetry and practicality. \"I should like it very much.\" \"And a frame for cucumbers -- like a gentleman and lady.\" Yes.\" \"And when the wedding was over, we'd have it put in the newspaper list of marriages.\" \"Dearly I should like that!\" \"And the babies in the births -- every man jack of \"em! And at home by the fire, whenever you look up, there I shall be -- and whenever I look up there will be you.\" \"Wait wait and don't be improper!\" Her countenance fell, and she was silent awhile. He regarded the red berries between them over and over again, to such an extent, that holly seemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of marriage. Bathsheba decisively turned to him. \"No;\" 'tis no use.\" she said. \"I don't want to marry you.\" \"Try.\" \"I have tried hard all the time I've been thinking; for a marriage would be very nice in one sense. People would talk about me, and think I had won my battle, and I should feel triumphant, and all that, But a husband -- -- -- \"Well!\" \"Why, he'd always be there, as you say; whenever I looked up, there he'd be.\" \"Of course he would -- I, that is.\" \"Well, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding, if I could be one without having a husband. But since a woman can't show off in that way by herself, I shan't marry -- at least yet.\" \"That's a terrible wooden story.\" At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away from him. \"Upon my heart and soul, I don't know what a maid can say stupider than that.\" said Oak. \"But dearest.\" he continued in a palliative voice, \"don't be like it!\" Oak sighed a deep honest sigh -- none the less so in that, being like the sigh of a pine plantation, it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo- sphere. \"Why won't you have me?\" he appealed, creeping round the holly to reach her side. \"I cannot.\" she said, retreating. \"But why?\" he persisted, standing still at last in despair of ever reaching her, and facing over the bush. \"Because I don't love you.\" \"Yes, but -- -- \" She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness, so that it was hardly ill-mannered at all. \"I don't love you.\" she said.\" \"But I love you -- and, as for myself, I am content to be liked.\" \"O Mr. Oak -- that's very fine! You'd get to despise me.\" \"Never.\" said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he seemed to be coming, by the force of his words, straight through the bush and into her arms. \"I shall do one thing in this life -- one thing certain -- that is, love you, and long for you, and keep wanting you till I die.\" His voice had a genuine pathos now, and his large brown hands perceptibly trembled. \"It seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much!\" she said with a little distress, and looking hopelessly around for some means of escape from her moral dilemma. \"H(ow I wish I hadn't run after you!\" However she seemed to have a short cut for getting back to cheerfulness, and set her face to signify archness. \"It wouldn't do, Mr Oak. I want somebody to tame me; I am too independent; and you would never be able to, I know.\" Oak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying that it was useless to attempt argument. \"Mr. Oak.\" she said, with luminous distinctness and common sense, \" you are better off than I. I have hardly a penny in the world -- I am staying with my aunt for my bare sustenance. I am better educated than you -- and I don't love you a bit: that's my side of the case. Now yours: you are a farmer just begin- ing; and you ought in common prudence, if you marry at all (which you should certainly not think of doing at present) to marry a woman with money, who would admiration. \"That's the very thing I had been thinking myself!\" he naively said. Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian character- istics too many to succeed with Bathsheba: his humility, and a superfluous moiety of honesty. Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted, \"Well, then, why did you come and disturb me?\" she said, almost angrily, if not quite, an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek. \"I can't do what I think would be -- would be -- -- \" \"Right?\" \"No: wise.\" \"You have made an admission now, Mr. Oak.\" she exclaimed, with even more hauteur, and rocking her head disdainfully. \"After that, do you think I could marry you? Not if I know it.\" He broke in passionately. \"But don't mistake me like that! Because I am open enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought of, you make your colours come up your face, and get crabbed with me. That about your not being good enough for me is nonsense. You speak like a lady -- all the parish notice it, and your uncle at Weatherbury is, I have heerd, a large farmer -- much larger than ever I shall be. May I call in the evening, or will you walk along with me o' Sundays? I don't want you to make-up your mind at once, if you'd rather not.\" \"No -- no -- I cannot. Don't press me any more -- don't. I don't love you -- so 'twould be ridiculous,\" he said, with a laugh. No man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry-go-round of skittishness. \"Very well.\" said Oak, firmly, with the bearing of one who was going to give \" his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever. \"Then I'll ask you no more.\" ","paragraph0_beginOffset":44291,"paragraph0_qc_offsets":"45875-45882,45916-45918,45969-45971,46054-46057,46086-46088,46119-46121,46165-46167,46466-46469,46540-46542,46591-46593,46652-46654,46661-46664,47194-47201,47295-47297,47557-47560,47606-47609,47688-47690,47869-47871,47891-47894,47953-47956,48095-48098,48152-48155,48348-48350,48366-48369,48424-48426,48532-48535,48959-48961,48990-48992,49085-49088,49130-49132,49242-49244,49629-49631,49943-49950,49981-49983,50011-50014,50270-50273,50822-50829,51103-51110,52072-52079,52129-52131,52166-52169,52299-52301,52344-52347,52452-52459,52733-52740,53119-53126,53187-53189,53970-53977,54023-54025,54234-54241,54425-54427,54459-54462,54498-54501,54593-54596,55612-55615,55864-55871,56267-56274,56311-56313,56704-56711","paragraph0_cc_offsets":"45653-45662,45663-45671,45830-45839,45840-45848,45986-45995,46634-46643,50345-50354,50718-50727,51055-51064,52432-52441,52442-52450,54474-54483,56183-56192,57389-57398,58116-58125,60553-60562,60616-60625","paragraph1":"CHAPTER V ","paragraph1_beginOffset":61963,"paragraph1_qc_offsets":null,"paragraph1_cc_offsets":null,"paragraph2":"DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA -- A PASTORAL TRAGEDY ","paragraph2_beginOffset":61976,"paragraph2_qc_offsets":null,"paragraph2_cc_offsets":null, "annotations": []}

Their mother, who came of an impoverished line of princes--the H----s-- had died at Petersburg when her husband was in his heydey. Anna's position after her father's death was very difficult. The brilliant education she had received in Petersburg had not fitted her for putting up with the cares of domestic life and economy,--for an obscure existence in the country. She knew positively no one in the whole neighbourhood, and there was no one she could consult. Her father had tried to avoid all contact with the neighbours; he despised them in his way, and they despised him in theirs. She did not lose her head, however, and promptly sent for a sister of her mother's Princess Avdotya Stepanovna H----, a spiteful and arrogant old lady, who, on installing herself in her niece's house, appropriated all the best rooms for her own use, scolded and grumbled from morning till night, and would not go a walk even in the garden unattended by her one serf, a surly footman in a threadbare pea-green livery with light blue trimming and a three-cornered hat. Anna put up patiently with all her aunt's whims, gradually set to work on her sister's education, and was, it seemed, already getting reconciled to the idea of wasting her life in the wilds.... But destiny had decreed another fate for her. She chanced to be seen by Odintsov, a very wealthy man of forty-six, an eccentric hypochondriac, stout, heavy, and sour, but not stupid, and not ill-natured; he fell in love with her, and offered her his hand. She consented to become his wife, and he lived six years with her, and on his death settled all his property upon her. Anna Sergyevna remained in the country for nearly a year after his death; then she went abroad with her sister, but only stopped in Germany; she got tired of it, and came back to live at her favourite Nikolskoe, which was nearly thirty miles from the town of X----. There she had a magnificent, splendidly furnished house and a beautiful garden, with conservatories; her late husband had spared no expense to gratify his fancies. Anna Sergyevna went very rarely to the town, generally only on business, and even then she did not stay long. She was not liked in the province; there had been a fearful outcry at her marriage with Odintsov, all sorts of fictions were told about her; it was asserted that she had helped her father in his cardsharping tricks, and even that she had gone abroad for excellent reasons, that it had been necessary to conceal the lamentable consequences ... 'You understand?' the indignant gossips would wind up. 'She has gone through the fire,' was said of her; to which a noted provincial wit usually added: 'And through all the other elements?' All this talk reached her; but she turned a deaf ear to it; there was much independence and a good deal of determination in her character.

He, contrary to his habit, was talking a good deal, and obviously trying to interest her--again a surprise for Arkady. He could not make up his mind whether Bazarov was attaining his object. It was difficult to conjecture from Anna Sergyevna's face what impression was being made on her; it retained the same expression, gracious and refined; her beautiful eyes were lighted up by attention, but by quiet attention. Bazarov's bad manners had impressed her unpleasantly for the first minutes of the visit like a bad smell or a discordant sound; but she saw at once that he was nervous, and that even flattered her. Nothing was repulsive to her but vulgarity, and no one could have accused Bazarov of vulgarity. Arkady was fated to meet with surprises that day. He had expected that Bazarov would talk to a clever woman like Madame Odintsov about his opinions and his views; she had herself expressed a desire to listen to the man 'who dares to have no belief in anything'; but, instead of that, Bazarov talked about medicine, about homoeopathy, and about botany. It turned out that Madame Odintsov had not wasted her time in solitude; she had read a good many excellent books, and spoke herself in excellent Russian. She turned the conversation upon music; but noticing that Bazarov did not appreciate art, she quietly brought it back to botany, even though Arkady was just launching into a discourse upon the significance of national melodies. Madame Odintsov treated him as though he were a younger brother; she seemed to appreciate his good-nature and youthful simplicity--and that was all.

Training and experience had taught her to be hospitable to newcomers, since the most unpromising might be useful later on, and there were plenty of available OUBLIETTES to swallow them if they were not.

A stranger looking on might well have smiled at the picture,--the great stately room, the big liveried servants, the bright lights, the glittering silver and glass, the fierce-looking old nobleman at the head of the table and the very small boy at the foot. Dinner was usually a very serious matter with the Earl--and it was a very serious matter with the cook, if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent appetite. To-day, however, his appetite seemed a trifle better than usual, perhaps because he had something to think of beside the flavor of the entrees and the management of the gravies. His grandson gave him something to think of. He kept looking at him across the table. He did not say very much himself, but he managed to make the boy talk. He had never imagined that he could be entertained by hearing a child talk, but Lord Fauntleroy at once puzzled and amused him, and he kept remembering how he had let the childish shoulder feel his weight just for the sake of trying how far the boy's courage and endurance would go, and it pleased him to know that his grandson had not quailed and had not seemed to think even for a moment of giving up what he had undertaken to do.
